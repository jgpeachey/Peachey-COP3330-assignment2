/*
Create a program that determines the complexity of a given password based on
these rules:

A very weak password contains only numbers and is fewer than eight characters.
A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than eight characters.
A strong password contains letters and at least one number and is at least eight characters.
A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and special characters and is at least eight characters.

Example Output:
The password '12345' is a very weak password.
The password 'abcdef' is a weak password.
The password 'abc123xyz' is a strong password.
The password '1337h@xor!' is a very strong password.

Constraints:
*Create a passwordValidator function that takes in the password as its argument
and returns a value you can evaluate to determine the password strength. Do not
have the function return a stringâ€”you may need to support multiple languages in
the future.
*Use a single output statement.

Challenge:
Create a GUI application or web application that displays graphical feedback as
well as text feedback in real time. As someone enters a password, determine its
strength and display the result
